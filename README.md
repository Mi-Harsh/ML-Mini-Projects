# Problem Statement
Consider a scenario where a submarine is navigating underwater amidst a conflict between two countries. The submarine is trying to infiltrate the waters of the enemy nation, which has strategically placed explosive mines in the ocean. These mines are designed to detonate upon contact with any object. Additionally, there are also rocks present in the ocean. It is crucial for the submarine to accurately distinguish between mines and rocks to avoid potential danger.

To achieve this, the submarine employs sonar technology (Sound Navigation and Ranging), which emits sound signals and interprets the echoes received. These sonar signals are then processed to determine whether the detected object is a mine or merely a rock.

## Algorithm
We will utilize a supervised machine learning algorithm, specifically Logistic Regression, to create a system capable of predicting whether the object detected by the submarine's sonar is a mine or a rock.
